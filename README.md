## Introduction:<br>
This app is part of the mobile application development module in the BSC in Computing in Software Development course in GMIT. I choose to do an app involving the sport of Darts early on but often found I was going down a route that I couldn't create what I initially envisioned that I wanted to create an app that would take in scores of games and write them to an table but with a limited knowledge of using xaml and c# I was unable to do this. I then decided to create an app that I could create an appointment to arrange meet ups for friends to pre arrange dart matches.
<br>
<br>
## Description: <br>
The app is designed to be used create appointment in the windows platform to pre arrange time in their calendar on their device. The appointments are made through the devices calendar and they need to be logged into their Microsoft account to use it properly. The second page is a basic scoreboard that allows the user to keep track of a darts game counting sets won and legs depending on the rules of the game. 
<br>
<br>
## User Guide: <br>
* To run the device open the project solution (DartScoreboardApp.csproj) in visual studio 2015.
* Run the project in the local machine.
* Wait for it to load and you will be at the Main PAge.
* Here you can fill in the fields (Date and Time, Subject matter, location, details, duration and to mark the appointment for the whole day or not.
* Press + to add the appointment(be sure to set the time at least a minute ahead to make sure it registers.
* New refreshes the fields and the calendar Icon directs the user to their accounts callendar.
* Press the button in the top left corner to open the slide panel, then press the button to go to the scoreboard page.
* Here you can Edit the user names (in the textboxes marked Player 1/ Player 2)
* Press on the 0's underneat to cout the sets and underneath them to count the legs.
* On this page you can also return to the main menu by pressing the left directed arrow <-

## Learning Outcomes:<br>
I cannot say that I feel I have learned a lot in the last few months doing C# programming and using xaml in the labs as those were basic and not very relatable to a project and doing an app with unique design principles. So when I wanted to create something I had to try attempt it myself rather than reference work previously done. Haven't been able to understand much in the way off error handling either. I'd prefer to stay working on apps while I have access to developers account through the Microsoft azure package for students.
